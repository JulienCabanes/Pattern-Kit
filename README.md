# Pattern Kit

Pattern Kit is a static site generator based on Twig, Silex & Grunt. It was built for Atomic Design like [Pattern Lab](http://pattern-lab.info/) but it is *not* a strict port of Pattern Lab.

## Install
### [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
Run this in your terminal to get the latest Composer version:
    curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Or if you don't have curl:
    php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php

This installer script will simply check some php.ini settings, warn you if they are set incorrectly, and then download the latest composer.phar in the current directory

Then run this:
    php composer.phar install

### [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/)
Run this to get NodeJS packages
    npm install
